# Tracked repositories for git-repo-checker sync
# Copy this to ./repos.yml or ~/.config/git-repo-checker/repos.yml
#
# These repos will be:
# - Cloned if they don't exist locally
# - Pulled if they exist and have upstream changes
#
# This helps keep multiple machines in sync with the same set of repos.

# Path prefix for all repos - can be overridden per-machine
# Use relative paths in repos list, they will be joined with path_prefix
# Override with: --path-prefix /other/path
# Or create ~/.config/git-repo-checker/local.yml with: path_prefix: /other/path
path_prefix: ~/code

  # Example entries - uncomment and modify as needed:

  #   branch: main    # optional, defaults to main
  #   ignore: false   # optional, set to true to skip this repo

  #   remote: git@github.com:company/project.git
